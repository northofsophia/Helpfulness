I think there are many advantages to listening to an audio book in my personal opinion. Sometimes the reader's voice even ties into the book, and makes the book feel even more real. For example, if you listen to a harry potter book using audible, the voice matches that of the characters in harry potter. Its that british sounding voice. In addition to this, you are able to listen to the book in many more situations and places than you would be able to physically read a book. I can lay down in bed without having to sit up and listen to a book, or listen to a book while driving, or while cleaning up in the house, or even while taking the dogs for a walk. This makes it much easier to indulge yourself into a good book. I personally do not feel that there are any advantages to reading a book physically over listening. I think it is simply preference. Reading is more quiet and can allow some people the ability to immerse themselves a little more. However, i dont really find reading to have any advantages like audiobooks do, especially for efficiency. I am a huge fan of being efficient, and being able to listen while still working or doing other activities is the seller for me.

Everyone has their own preference, however i like being able to listen to a book because it allows me to do other things while i listen. When you are physically reading a book, you cannot really multitask. When you have four kids, two dogs, and a wife you are really just trying to be as efficient as you can throughout the day. Being able to plug in and hear a nice book while doing house work or walking the dogs is great! I feel i am able to improve myself as a person without stressing myself out over loosing time for tasks. Not only this, but it has given me a full library of books to choose from that i would need to physically go to the library to have access to. Another reason i personally prefer audiobooks is the fact that the titles are cheaper to buy on the audiobook platform than they are to buy physical copies for. This is a no brainer since it costs to print the actual book.

Being able to immerse yourself in the book in complete silence is a very therapeutic experience. This alone by itself may be something that helps enhances someone's calm and i understand that. Not everyone likes to multi task all the time, and for some people reading is just something that allows them to get their minds off of things and focus on one thing. I have had my moments like this, and for this situation maybe reading is the way to go, or even using an audiobook and just closing your eyes. I am a very overactive person, so the thought of not being productive can stress me out. This is why i like using the audiobooks when i am doing other things.

I think that since screens are simply a part of our lives now, it really only depends on how it is used. I would say that the majority of people without a doubt abuse it, however there are some that use it an extremely productive ways. I think that during the pandemic specifically, social media and screens is really the only thing that made us feel connected. Without social media, i think the pandemic would have felt a lot more lonely. We would have felt like we were living in the early 20th century or something like that. I think this would have made people go crazy. People would have been fighting over resources and fending for their lives like it was an apocolypse simply because it is so different to how we live today. So overall to me social media is what helped the pandemic a lot, but of course with any positive comes a negative. Social media also caused a lot of depression and mental issues.

She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around.

The app primarily showcases only the positive aspects of a person, which includes their achievements, skills, experience, and more.

I would look at high school more of a way to prepare young adults for their future and life on their own as opposed to preparing them for college. All the more advanced types of maths and sciences arent all that beneficial to many of the lives of students, especially those who plan on working after graduation. The classes i feel should be implemented more often stem around life skills, and mental health. I believe there should be an entire class on finances in my opinion. An entire marking period or semester spent on credit, one spent on investing and saving, one spent on debt and saving, etc. Just more life skills over the general education types of courses. Not only this but i think nutrition should be tought on a much mora in depth inway. I think itd be a great idea to teach about foods as a way to heal your body, like medicine. This can tie into mental health. Instead of looking for drugs to feel better and less anxious, how about trying some magnesium. Maybe eating a higher fat diet will slow your mind down anxiety wise, eating more pastured eggs, or nutritious foods like raw milk, organ meats, fatty fish, etc. The most important thing i learned in school personally had nothing to do with any of my classes. The thing i learned was simply about myself and how i interact with other people. I was often uncomfortable in school because i was being forced to act a certain way in a classroom full of kids. I learned that i was insecure in certain ways, and confident in certain ways. It helped my future because i knew where i needed to grow personally, and i realized what i could do to help myself through my own research.
