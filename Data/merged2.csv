I think there are many advantages to listening to an audio book in my personal opinion. Sometimes the reader's voice even ties into the book, and makes the book feel even more real. For example, if you listen to a harry potter book using audible, the voice matches that of the characters in harry potter. Its that british sounding voice. In addition to this, you are able to listen to the book in many more situations and places than you would be able to physically read a book. I can lay down in bed without having to sit up and listen to a book, or listen to a book while driving, or while cleaning up in the house, or even while taking the dogs for a walk. This makes it much easier to indulge yourself into a good book. I personally do not feel that there are any advantages to reading a book physically over listening. I think it is simply preference. Reading is more quiet and can allow some people the ability to immerse themselves a little more. However, i dont really find reading to have any advantages like audiobooks do, especially for efficiency. I am a huge fan of being efficient, and being able to listen while still working or doing other activities is the seller for me.

Everyone has their own preference, however i like being able to listen to a book because it allows me to do other things while i listen. When you are physically reading a book, you cannot really multitask. When you have four kids, two dogs, and a wife you are really just trying to be as efficient as you can throughout the day. Being able to plug in and hear a nice book while doing house work or walking the dogs is great! I feel i am able to improve myself as a person without stressing myself out over loosing time for tasks. Not only this, but it has given me a full library of books to choose from that i would need to physically go to the library to have access to. Another reason i personally prefer audiobooks is the fact that the titles are cheaper to buy on the audiobook platform than they are to buy physical copies for. This is a no brainer since it costs to print the actual book.

There are no real disadvantages for me personally. This being said i understand the perspective of someone who would prefer physically reading a book. Being able to immerse yourself in the book in complete silence is a very therapeutic experience. This alone by itself may be something that helps enhances someone's calm and i understand that. Not everyone likes to multi task all the time, and for some people reading is just something that allows them to get their minds off of things and focus on one thing. I have had my moments like this, and for this situation maybe reading is the way to go, or even using an audiobook and just closing your eyes. I am a very overactive person, so the thought of not being productive can stress me out. This is why i like using the audiobooks when i am doing other things. I feel i get more of the book when i listen when going for a drive or for a run. If you are pushing yourself during a run sometimes all you want to think about is the book to not think about how you are running up this gigantic hill and you have more hills to go.","Sure you can listen to any music, but there is something about listening to a book that all ties into one intricate picture in my head when i run",0.5444016346797194,0.9092949608352487,0.4672771096229553,0.4083333333333332,0.5,0.7666666666666667,accepted

I think that since screens are simply a part of our lives now, it really only depends on how it is used. I would say that the majority of people without a doubt abuse it, however there are some that use it an extremely productive ways. I think that during the pandemic specifically, social media and screens is really the only thing that made us feel connected. Without social media, i think the pandemic would have felt a lot more lonely. We would have felt like we were living in the early 20th century or something like that. I think this would have made people go crazy. People would have been fighting over resources and fending for their lives like it was an apocolypse simply because it is so different to how we live today. So overall to me social media is what helped the pandemic a lot, but of course with any positive comes a negative. Social media also caused a lot of depression and mental issues.

""That's uranium.  It can kill you,"" the wolf said.

""How do you know?"" the 92nd pig asked.

The wolf explained that he studied chemistry in college.  He started to talk about radioactive elements and the 92nd pig invited him in for tea. ""Uhm"" the wolf said, ""that's not a good idea. I'm not going into your house, and you shouldn't either.  It's too dangerous.""

The 92nd little pig looked so pitiful standing there, the wolf invited him back to his place.  The pig didn't have anywhere else to go, so he packed a bag and followed the wolf.  They went into his den and the wolf turned on the television.  ""Sit down,"" he said to the pig.  Then the wolf went into the kitchen and came back with a tray full of snacks.  ""I thought you might be hungry,"" he said.

The little pig picked up a plate and loaded it with the goodies the wolf had laid out on the tray.  The two of them chatted and watched a football game together in the den.  Finally, as night fell, the 92nd pig asked the question that had been weighing heavily on his all day.
